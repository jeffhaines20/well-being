Comparison of Supervised Learning Models to Predict Emotions

This project is a partial replication attempt of the results found in Margolis et al. 2021 - "What Are the Most Important Predictors of Subjective Well-Being? Insights From Machine Learning and Linear Regression Approaches on the MIDUS Datasets (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356155467_What_Are_the_Most_Important_Predictors_of_Subjective_Well-Being_Insights_From_Machine_Learning_and_Linear_Regression_Approaches_on_the_MIDUS_Datasets)

The project includes cleaning, EDA, and supervised learning models to predict how often respondents to a national survey reported feeling positive and negative emotions. The project also include predictions made after PCA was used to reduce the large number of dimensions of the data. In the final results, random forest on the unreduced (high dimensional) data had the lowest MSE and highest R2, only somewhat confirming the results of Margolis et al.
